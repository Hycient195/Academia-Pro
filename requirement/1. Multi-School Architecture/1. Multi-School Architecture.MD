# Multi-School Architecture Module

## Overview
The Multi-School Architecture forms the foundation of Academia Pro, enabling centralized management of multiple educational institutions while maintaining complete data isolation and school-specific customization.

## Core Processes

### 1. School Onboarding Process

#### Process Flow:
1. **Super Admin Initiation**
   - Super administrator creates new school profile
   - Define school basic information (name, address, contact details)
   - Set school type (primary, secondary, or both)
   - Configure regional settings and compliance requirements

2. **School Configuration Setup**
   - Define school structure (grades, sections, subjects)
   - Configure academic calendar and terms
   - Set up fee structures and payment policies
   - Establish user roles and permission templates

3. **Data Isolation Setup**
   - Create dedicated database schema for the school
   - Configure access controls and data segregation
   - Set up encryption keys and security protocols
   - Initialize audit logging for the school

4. **Integration Configuration**
   - Configure third-party integrations (payment gateways, SMS)
   - Set up regional compliance settings
   - Configure notification preferences
   - Establish backup and recovery procedures

#### Success Criteria:
- School data completely isolated from other institutions
- All configurations applied successfully
- Initial user accounts created and activated
