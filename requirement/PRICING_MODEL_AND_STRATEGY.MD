# Credit-Based Pricing System Analysis

## Overview
A credit-based system transforms Academia Pro's flexible pricing into a more granular, usage-based model where schools purchase "credits" that can be used across different system components. This approach provides maximum flexibility while maintaining revenue predictability.

## Credit System Architecture

### **Credit Types & Structure**

- Fee Management: 0.3 credits per student
- Online Learning: 1.0 credit per active student
- Advanced Analytics: 2.0 credits per school

#### **2. Student Capacity Credits**
**Purpose**: Scale system usage based on student enrollment
**Credit Value**: 1 credit = 1 student access per month
**Usage Examples**:
- Basic student access: 1 credit per student
- Premium features: Additional 0.5 credits per student
- Mobile app access: 0.2 credits per student
- Parent portal: 0.1 credits per student

#### **3. Feature Usage Credits**
**Purpose**: Pay for advanced features and integrations
**Credit Value**: Variable based on feature complexity
**Usage Examples**:
- API integrations: 10 credits per active integration
- Custom reports: 5 credits per report generation
- Bulk operations: 2 credits per 100 records
- Advanced analytics: 15 credits per dashboard

#### **4. Storage & Bandwidth Credits**
**Purpose**: Cover infrastructure and data costs
**Credit Value**: 1 credit = 1GB storage or 10GB bandwidth
**Usage Examples**:
- Document storage: 1 credit per 10GB
- Database storage: 2 credits per 10GB
- Backup storage: 0.5 credits per 10GB
- CDN bandwidth: 1 credit per 100GB

### **Credit Purchasing & Management**

#### **Credit Packages**
| Package Type | Credits Included | Price | Validity | Best For |
|-------------|------------------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Starter** | 5,000 credits | $2,500 | 12 months | Small schools |

| **Enterprise** | 50,000 credits | $15,000 | 12 months | Large schools |
| **Pay-as-you-go** | Variable | $0.50/credit | No expiry | Variable usage |

#### **Credit Rollover Policy**
- **Unused credits**: 90% rollover to next period
- **Expiration**: Credits expire after 24 months
- **Transferability**: Credits can be transferred between modules
- **Refunds**: Unused credits refunded at 80% value

## Credit Consumption Model

### **Monthly Credit Calculation**

```typescript
interface SchoolUsage {
  studentCount: number;
  activeModules: string[];
  featureUsage: FeatureUsage[];
  storageUsed: number;
  apiCalls: number;
}

const calculateMonthlyCredits = (usage: SchoolUsage): number => {
  const studentCredits = usage.studentCount * 1.0; // Base student access
  const moduleCredits = usage.activeModules.length * 0.5 * usage.studentCount;
  const featureCredits = calculateFeatureCredits(usage.featureUsage);
  const storageCredits = (usage.storageUsed / 10) * 1.0; // Per 10GB
  const apiCredits = Math.ceil(usage.apiCalls / 1000) * 1.0; // Per 1000 calls

  return studentCredits + moduleCredits + featureCredits + storageCredits + apiCredits;
};
```

### **Real-Time Credit Tracking**

#### **Credit Dashboard Features**
- **Current Balance**: Real-time credit availability
- **Usage Trends**: Daily/weekly/monthly consumption patterns
- **Module Breakdown**: Credits used by each module
- **Low Balance Alerts**: Automatic notifications at 20%, 10%, 5% thresholds
- **Usage Forecasting**: Predictive credit consumption

#### **Credit Allocation Strategy**

- Student Credits: 2,000 × 1.0 = 2,000 credits
- Module Credits: 18 × 0.5 × 2,000 = 18,000 credits
- Feature Credits: ~2,000 credits (advanced usage)
- **Total Monthly**: ~22,000 credits
- **Annual Cost**: 22,000 × 12 × $0.40 = $105,600
