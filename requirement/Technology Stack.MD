# Academia Pro - Technology Stack Specification

## Project Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive technology stack for the Academia Pro School Management System, designed to support 21 integrated modules, multi-school architecture, and enterprise-grade requirements.

## Core Technology Decisions

### Database Architecture Decision
**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Database Choice Analysis**

Based on the comprehensive ER diagram with complex relationships across 25+ entities, **PostgreSQL** is strongly recommended over MongoDB due to:

- **Complex Relationships**: Extensive foreign key relationships between schools, users, students, classes, subjects, etc.
- **ACID Compliance**: Required for financial transactions, attendance tracking, and academic records
- **Data Integrity**: Critical for student records, examination results, and compliance reporting
- **Advanced Features**: Full-text search, JSON support, advanced indexing, and stored procedures
- **Enterprise Features**: Row-level security, partitioning, and advanced concurrency control

**Recommendation**: PostgreSQL 15+ with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data (attendance, analytics)

### Common Types Architecture
- A folder sitting side-by side client and server would be used as a package for type definitions for both front-end and back-end, ensuring appropriate typing between both ends.
- The types would be grouped according to the modules, and further ordererd according to the submodules for better predictability
- Types for API Request would have the suffix "Request", and types for API Response would have the suffix "Response". All interface types should be prefixed with the letter "I" (eg: ICreateUserRequest), and all 'type' types should be prefixed with the letter "T" (example: TCoordinates)
- DTOs on the back-end should implement the types specified in the common types package to ensure consistency, whilst still being to specify property constraints. Example
`class CreateCommunityDto implements ICreateCommunityRequest`
- Other shared functionality, constants, etc, beetween front-end and back-end would also be contained in this "common" folder
